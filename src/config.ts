/**
 * Environment configuration — two things and the process's own knobs.
 *
 * A deployment states only how to reach the settings store:
 *
 *   NOCODB_BASE_URL     where the settings live
 *   NOCODB_API_TOKEN    how to read them
 *
 * Everything else — the MySQL coordinates, the trusted network, the public
 * URL, provider credentials — is a row in the `auth_tbl_Settings` table of
 * the `IdentityBase` base (see settings.ts). The base and table are named by
 * convention, not configured, and the base ID is detected from that name at
 * runtime; a base ID in a config file is exactly the coupling the convention
 * exists to remove.
 *
 * Any of those rows may still be pinned in the environment:
 * `settingOverridesFromEnv()` reads every KNOWN_SETTINGS key (and the
 * environment-shaped aliases beside them) straight from process.env and
 * gives it precedence over the store. That is an override for deployments
 * that manage configuration as environment, not a default — nothing here
 * invents a value for something the deployment has not stated.
 *
 * APP_BASE_URL in particular needs no answer anywhere: left unset, the
 * public base URL is the URL the browser actually reached this service on
 * (app.ts), and the setup wizard persists exactly that. The one assumption
 * the code makes about it is the naming convention identity.X.TLD (web.ts).
