# identity — OAuth identity processor & redirector

`identity` is the single sign-in surface for every application under one parent
domain (`X.TLD`). Applications never talk to Google, Microsoft, or the UISP
bridge themselves — they redirect the browser to `identity.X.TLD`, and `identity` hands
back a one-time code that resolves to the signed-in identity.

```

## Flows

**Application login.** An app with no local session sends the browser to

```
GET https://identity.X.TLD/authorize?redirect_uri=https://app.X.TLD/auth/callback&state=<opaque>
```

`redirect_uri` must be an https URL whose host is the parent domain or any
subdomain of it — that is the entire client-registration model; every app
under `X.TLD` is trusted, nothing else is. If the browser already carries a
valid `id_sso` cookie (scoped to `.X.TLD`, so one login serves every app),
`identity` immediately 302s back with `?code=…&state=…`. Otherwise the login page
is shown and the round trip completes after the user authenticates.

The app then redeems the code server-to-server:

```
POST https://identity.X.TLD/api/token
{ "code": "…", "redirect_uri": "https://app.X.TLD/auth/callback" }

→ { "user": { "iUserId", "email", "displayName", "superAdmin" },
    "identity": { "provider", "subject" },
    "identities": [ { "provider", "subject", "email" }, … ] }
```

Codes are single-use, expire in 5 minutes, and are bound to the exact
`redirect_uri` they were minted for. No application secret is required:
the calling server is admitted by **network trust** (below). The legacy
`IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` check still exists behind `IDENTITY_APP_AUTH_MODE` for the
rollout window.

`user.superAdmin` is **session-scoped and never stored on the user row**.
Its provenance is pinned by the contract: an existing SSO session's
`bSuperAdmin` is copied into the auth code at `/authorize`, and redemption
returns the consumed code's value; a fresh login computes it once and
writes the same value to both Session and AuthCode. Redemption never
recalculates privilege from the email.

## Network trust (POC: IPv4/CIDR policy)

The server-only endpoints — `POST /api/token`, `POST /api/apps/register`,
`GET /api/events`, and everything under `/api/directory/` — accept a
request only when the caller's resolved IPv4 peer is inside
`trustedCIDR` — one IPv4 CIDR naming the network the platform's
servers sit on (`/32` and bare addresses accepted; a comma-separated list
is still parsed for servers that straddle two ranges, and the pre-rollout
name `ID_TRUSTED_APP_CIDRS` (pre-rollout) is still honoured). It describes a *network*,
not an application. Browser authorization stays public.

Resolution rules, applied deterministically:

- The **TCP socket peer** is authoritative. Real IPv6 peers are rejected
  (a kernel-reported `::ffff:a.b.c.d` dual-stack peer is normalised to
  IPv4).
- `X-Forwarded-For` is honoured **only** when the socket peer is a private
  address (RFC1918, loopback, link-local), and only across private hops
  evaluated right-to-left; the first public hop is the client. Malformed,
  IPv6, or IPv4-mapped entries in the header are rejected outright.
  **There is nothing to configure.** A reverse proxy in front of this app
  reaches it over a private network by construction, while a caller
  arriving straight off the internet presents a public peer and never has
  its header believed — so the rule that decides whether to read the
  header is the socket peer, which cannot be forged over TCP.
- Denials are a generic `403 { "error": "Forbidden", "correlationId" }`;
  the log line carrying that correlation id records the resolved peer IP.
- Startup **fails** whenever any CIDR entry is malformed, and — in
  production, once the instance is claimed — when `IDENTITY_APP_AUTH_MODE`
  needs CIDRs and `trustedCIDR` is empty. An *unclaimed* instance starts with
  a warning instead: every setting is empty on a fresh install, and dying
  here would make the wizard that fills them in unreachable. Nothing is
  admitted in the meantime — an empty `trustedCIDR` denies every caller to
  the server-only endpoints.

`IDENTITY_APP_AUTH_MODE` is the rollout flag: `cidr` (POC default), `secret`
(legacy `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` only), or `dual` (either accepted) for the
migration window. The directory endpoints are CIDR-only in **every** mode —
no client-secret header or body field is ever accepted there.

Enforce the same policy at the edge as well as in the app. NGINX, with
apps at `203.0.113.7` and an internal `10.9.0.0/16`:

```nginx
# Server-only API: allowlist app servers, deny the world.
location ~ ^/api/(token|apps/register|events|directory) {
    allow 203.0.113.7/32;
    allow 10.9.0.0/16;
    deny  all;
    proxy_pass http://identity:3200;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
# Everything else (authorize, login, account, admin) stays public.
location / {
    proxy_pass http://identity:3200;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

`$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` is the part that matters: it appends the
address NGINX saw, which is what makes the app's right-to-left walk
immune to a forged hop. NGINX reaches the app over a private network, so
the app reads that header with nothing configured on either side.
Firewall prerequisite: only the reverse proxy (and, on the controlled
host, the app servers) may reach the app port at all — the allowlist is
defence in depth, not the only wall.

For **outbound** event delivery, the receiving application's `/id/events`
endpoint applies the mirror-image policy: allowlist id's egress IPv4/CIDRs
at its ingress. TLS protects the transport; event ids and timestamps drive
idempotency and replay handling. The per-app webhook HMAC is no longer part
of the POC contract — the signature header is still sent when the app holds
a legacy secret, but verifying it is optional.

## The machine-readable contract

The versioned integration contract lives at
[`docs/openapi.json`](docs/openapi.json) (OpenAPI 3.1), with response
fixtures under [`docs/contract/fixtures/`](docs/contract/fixtures/) and a
typed TypeScript client in [`src/contractClient.ts`](src/contractClient.ts)
that compiles with the build. `npm test` validates the fixtures against the
contract and pins the POC invariants (superAdmin provenance, exact redirect
binding, single-use five-minute codes, no secret fields); CI additionally
rejects breaking contract changes on pull requests (`oasdiff`). `X.TLD` in
the contract is the configured `PARENT_DOMAIN` placeholder — `localsplash.ai`
URLs anywhere are deployment examples, never normative.

## Central user directory (CIDR-trusted, server-only)

Lets a trusted application (AidaAdmin) create, locate, and select central
users by `iUserId` without direct MySQL access or duplicate person records:

```
POST /api/directory/users            { email, displayName?, idempotencyKey? }
GET  /api/directory/users/{iUserId}
GET  /api/directory/users?query=&limit=25&cursor=
→ { iUserId, email, displayName, claimed }
```

The ensure is idempotent and concurrency-safe: repeat calls (same email,
or same `idempotencyKey`) return the same `iUserId`. A pre-created user is
`claimed: false` until a **trusted-provider** login with a matching
verified email attaches an identity — the same email-match path every
login uses — after which the person signs in holding the UID that was
handed out here. Untrusted providers can never claim a UID by asserted
email. Responses are deliberately minimal: never identities, sessions,
codes, or OAuth credentials.

**Sessions persist forever — until revoked.** There is no expiry. A login
ends only when the user signs out, signs out everywhere, or a Super System
Admin revokes their sessions. Applications are expected to follow the same
model for their own local sessions.

**UISP bridge.** The ISP-portal plugin (shipped separately)
verifies the subscriber's portal session and redirects to
`/sso/callback?code&sig` with an HMAC-signed one-time payload. `identity` verifies
the signature and nonce, records a `uisp` identity (subject = CRM clientId),
and completes the pending app redirect — or `DEFAULT_REDIRECT_URI` when the
user entered straight from the portal.

## Installing

```bash
scripts/install.sh      # generates the DB passwords, brings everything up
```

Then open the service in a browser and follow `/setup`. That is the whole
installation: nothing else is edited by hand.

Identity owns its data. `docker-compose.yml` brings up its own MySQL on a
private network — not published, not shared — and this app applies its own
schema to it. The only thing it expects to already exist is a NocoDB.

## Configuration

**Zero-config is the intended path.** A fresh instance is expected at
`identity.X.TLD` and asks for what it needs in the browser.

Three things cannot be answered by the settings table, because they are how
the settings table is reached or how the app is admitted to at all. The
first-run wizard collects them:

| Collected in step 1 | Saved to | Why not a settings row |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NocoDB URL | `/data/config.json` | It is where the settings are |
| NocoDB API token | `/data/config.json` | It is how they are read |
| `trustedCIDR` | `auth_tbl_Settings` | Required before anything is admitted; the row itself is platform-wide, so it goes to the store like every other setting |

`/data` is the `identity-config` volume, so an instance is set up once and
survives rebuilds. Both NocoDB values may instead be stated in `.env`, where
they win and the wizard skips step 1.

Everything else — the trusted network, the public URL, the OAuth
credentials — is a row in the **`auth_tbl_Settings`** table of the
**`IdentityBase`** base in NocoDB at `nocodb.X.TLD`. The MySQL coordinates
come from `docker-compose.yml` and are not asked about at all.

### Naming

| Thing | Rule | Here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public URL | `{repo}.X.TLD`, lowercase | `identity.X.TLD` |
| NocoDB base | `{Repo}Base` | `IdentityBase` |
| Settings table | `auth_tbl_Settings` | `auth_tbl_Settings` |

The short form `id` is retired: it reads as "identifier" everywhere it
appears, which is genuinely ambiguous in an application whose primary key is
one. Column names (`iUserId`), OAuth's own vocabulary (`client_id`) and the
event names in the contract keep their spelling — there the word *does* mean
identifier.

### The base is found by name

A base name is unique **by our convention** — NocoDB does not enforce it, we
do — so the base ID is detected from the name at runtime and never written
into a config file, where it would survive a rename and outlive a restore.
Two bases sharing the name is a configuration error this app refuses to
guess its way past.

### Caching and refresh

A change made in NocoDB reaches a running instance **without a restart**:

- values are cached in-process for **30 seconds**;
- the resolved **base ID and table ID sit on the same 30-second clock**, so a
  rename, a recreate or a restore is picked up on the next refresh;
- any failed read or resolution **drops the cache**, so the next attempt
  re-detects rather than reusing an ID it could not confirm;
- a write through `/admin` invalidates immediately (read-your-writes);
- the retry on the unavailable page forces re-detection on demand.

### Failure is loud

There is no fallback. If NocoDB is unreachable, the token is rejected, or no
base named `IdentityBase` exists:

- **at startup** the app retries once after 5 seconds, then exits non-zero
  naming the URL, the base and which of the three it was;
- **at runtime** requests that need settings answer `503` — browsers get a
  page saying what is wrong with a **Retry** that re-detects, everything else
  gets the same sentence as JSON;
- `/healthz` needs no settings and keeps answering, so "the process is up" is
  distinguishable from "the process cannot read its configuration".

### The settings

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` | The MySQL database this app owns and migrates itself. Collected by the first-run wizard; a change takes a restart |
| `trustedCIDR` | **One value for the whole platform** — the network the servers sit on. Every application reads this same key rather than spelling the same network under its own name |
| `PARENT_DOMAIN` | Apex domain (`X.TLD`) the **apps** are served from; drives the cookie scope and redirect allowlist, and is the default super-admin domain |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Public base URL, e.g. `https://identity.X.TLD`. Normally left to the wizard — see *Where this service thinks it lives* below |
| `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Legacy (rollout only)** — shared secret apps present at `/api/token` when `IDENTITY_APP_AUTH_MODE` is `secret`/`dual`; ignored in the default `cidr` mode |
| `SUPERADMIN_DOMAIN` | Domain(s) the **identity provider vouches for** whose users are Super System Admins — comma-separated list accepted (default: `PARENT_DOMAIN`) |
| `DEFAULT_REDIRECT_URI` | Where an unsolicited sign-in (e.g. from the ISP portal) lands |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` / `MICROSOFT_TENANT` | Microsoft Entra ID OAuth |
| `UISP_SSO_SECRET` / `UISP_PLUGIN_URL` / `UISP_BASE_URL` / `UISP_CRM_APP_KEY_READ` | UISP bridge & CRM |

On first boot the base and table are created and every known key is seeded
with an **empty** value and a description, so the menu of settings is visible
without guessing. Seeded rows stay empty on purpose: a table being created
for the first time is not where a public URL or a domain gets invented. **A
login method is only offered when all of its required keys are set.**

### Environment overrides

Any key above may also be set in the environment, where it wins over the
stored row. That is the escape hatch for deployments that manage
configuration as environment — an override, not a default, and the
zero-config path leaves all of it unset. An overridden key is read-only in
`/admin` (tagged `env`, `409` on any attempt to write it) and is never copied
into the store. Blank counts as unset.

Two keys read oddly as variables and have environment-shaped aliases:
`IDENTITY_TRUSTED_NETWORK` pins `trustedCIDR`, and the pre-rollout names
`ID_TRUSTED_NETWORK`, `ID_TRUSTED_APP_CIDRS` and `ID_CLIENT_SECRET` are still
honoured for one release.

### Where this service thinks it lives

`APP_BASE_URL` is what the OAuth callback URIs are built from, resolved per
request in this order:

1. the environment override, if there is one;
2. the `APP_BASE_URL` row — what the setup wizard wrote;
3. the URL the browser actually reached this service on (honouring
   `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` from a reverse proxy);
4. `https://identity.<PARENT_DOMAIN>` — the naming convention, for the rare
   call with no request to observe.

Leave 1 and 2 unset and the service is simply correct about itself.
`PARENT_DOMAIN` follows the same convention in the wizard — this host minus
its own label, so `identity.wisp.net` proposes `wisp.net`.

### First-run setup wizard

While no OAuth provider is configured, the instance is **unclaimed**: `/`
redirects to `/setup`, a built-in wizard that walks the first admin through
claiming it.

> **The wizard is open to whoever reaches it.** Whoever completes it becomes
> Super System Admin, and it closes for good the moment one provider is
> configured. The page says so. On a service reachable from the internet,
> the gap between "it answers" and "it is claimed" is a gap someone else can
> step into — finish the wizard immediately, then confirm on `/admin` that
> the only Super System Admin is you.

1. **Step 1, before this app knows anything about itself:** the NocoDB URL,
   an API token, and the trusted network. The address is proved before it is
   saved — the base is found or created, and the settings table with it — so
   a typo is a message on the page rather than a restart loop to read logs
   over. `trustedCIDR` is required here on purpose: it is the one security
   decision that cannot wait for a later screen, because the endpoints it
   guards exist the moment the process listens. The NocoDB coordinates are
   written to `/data/config.json`, `trustedCIDR` goes to the settings table
   where every application reads it, and the service restarts into them.
   Skipped entirely when `.env` already states the NocoDB values.

   There is no step for the identity database. It is the MySQL in
   `docker-compose.yml`, and the app migrates it itself.
2. The wizard fills in this service's public URL from the browser's own
   address bar and the application domain from that host minus its label
   (`identity.wisp.net` → `wisp.net`) — both editable, neither guessed
   server-side, and both fixed and read-only when the environment pins
   them. The admin confirms the application domain (`X.TLD`) and enters
   credentials for **Google or Microsoft** (the wizard is limited to
   providers that can prove a domain; Microsoft additionally requires a
   tenant ID — `common` cannot prove anything). In production the service
   URL must be on the domain being claimed. A Super Admin domain can be given too, but it is
   optional — see below.
3. The credentials are held in a short-lived cookie — *not* saved — while a
   real OAuth round trip runs against them.
4. Only if the sign-in works **and** the verified account is on the Super
   Admin domain does the wizard persist everything to `auth_tbl_Settings` (also
   minting `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`), make the claimer Super System Admin, and
   land them on `/admin`. A failed or off-domain attempt saves nothing.
5. If the sign-in works but the account is on a *different* domain, the
   wizard says which domain the provider actually vouched for and offers it
   as the Super Admin domain. Confirming re-runs the sign-in with that value
   in place — so the grant still rests on a fresh, matching identity, never
   on the suggestion.

The wizard closes permanently the moment any provider is configured; later
changes happen in `/admin` or directly in NocoDB at `nocodb.X.TLD`.

To start over, remove the `identity-config` volume (the app forgets where
its settings are and step 1 returns) and clear the provider rows in
`auth_tbl_Settings` (the instance becomes unclaimed again).

## Super System Admin

A user is a Super System Admin when their **provider-verified** email
domain is one of `SUPERADMIN_DOMAIN` (default: `PARENT_DOMAIN`). Only
providers that cryptographically vouch for the domain qualify — Google
(Workspace `hd` / verified address) does; Microsoft only when the app is
locked to a single tenant, since with a `common` authority any directory
could assert any address. Admins can edit `auth_tbl_Settings`, inspect users and
identities, unlink identities (never a user's last one), and revoke
sessions.

### When the app domain and the identity domain differ

`PARENT_DOMAIN` and `SUPERADMIN_DOMAIN` answer two different questions —
where the apps live, and where the people come from — and they are
routinely not the same string.

The everyday case is a **Google Workspace domain alias**. With apps at
`*.example.ai` and a Workspace whose *primary* domain is `example.com`,
`example.ai` being an alias, every sign-in comes back as
`user@example.com` with `hd=example.com`. Google asserts the primary domain
and never the alias — signing in as `user@example.ai` resolves to the same
account and still yields the primary in the token. There is no runtime
signal that ties the two domains together (the alias list is only readable
through an admin-scoped Directory API call, which an external consent
screen cannot ask for), so the relationship is **declared, not detected**:

```
PARENT_DOMAIN      = example.ai      # cookie scope, redirect allowlist
SUPERADMIN_DOMAIN  = example.com     # what Google actually vouches for
```

The setup wizard reaches this configuration for you — it reports the domain
the provider vouched for and offers it — but it is one line to set by hand
too.

The list form covers a later move from alias to **secondary domain**, where
some users hold genuine `@example.ai` primaries and arrive with
`hd=example.ai`: set `SUPERADMIN_DOMAIN = example.com, example.ai` and both
populations qualify, with no migration.

## Integrating an application

Each app's session is its own — id's session and the app's are separate
rows behind separate cookies. That is what makes the app fast (no round
trip per request), and it is also why an app has to be *told* when a login
is revoked: without that, revoking at id only stops **new** sign-ins while
the person stays logged into every app they already reached.

Apps therefore implement one endpoint. There is no polling and no cron.

### 1. Register on boot

```http
POST /api/apps/register
Content-Type: application/json

{ "name": "ExampleApp",
  "webhook_url": "https://app.X.TLD/id/events" }
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "origin": "https://app.X.TLD", "secret": "…",
  "events": ["ping", "session.revoked", "user.merged", "identity.linked", "identity.unlinked"],
  "signature": { "header": "X-Id-Signature", "required": false } }
```

The call is admitted by network trust (the app server's IP), like every
server-only endpoint. `webhook_url` must be https and under
`PARENT_DOMAIN` — the same rule as a `redirect_uri`. The returned `secret`
is the **legacy** delivery-signing key: deliveries still carry a signature
when the app holds one, but verifying it is optional in the POC — the
receiving endpoint's own IP allowlist plus TLS is the trust story. id
immediately queues a `ping` so a broken endpoint shows up now rather than
at the first real revocation.

### 2. Receive events

```http
POST /id/events
X-Id-Event: session.revoked
X-Id-Event-Id: 1234
X-Id-Timestamp: 1774500000
X-Id-Signature: sha256=<hex>

{ "id": 1234, "type": "session.revoked", "occurredAt": "2026-08-26T06:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { "iUserId": 7, "scope": "all" } }
```

A receiver **must**:

- allowlist id's egress IPv4/CIDRs at its ingress (the POC trust model —
  TLS protects the transport);
- be **idempotent**, deduplicating on the event `id` — failures are
  retried, so the same event id can arrive more than once;
- answer **2xx only once the event is durably handled**. Anything else, or a
  timeout past 10s, counts as a failure.

A receiver **may** additionally verify the legacy `X-Id-Signature` header
(`HMAC-SHA256(secret, "<X-Id-Timestamp>.<rawBody>")` over the **raw** body,
constant-time compare, timestamp within **300s**) — optional in the POC.

Retries back off at 0s, 30s, 2m, 10m, 1h, 6h and are then abandoned and
shown in the dashboard.

| Event | `data` | What the app should do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ping` | `{ origin }` | Nothing; answer 2xx |
| `session.revoked` | `{ iUserId, scope: 'all' \| 'one', sessionId? }` | End its own sessions for that id user |
| `user.merged` | `{ fromUserId, toUserId }` | Repoint its local mapping from `fromUserId` to `toUserId`, end sessions for the retired user |
| `identity.linked` / `identity.unlinked` | `{ iUserId, provider, subject }` | Usually nothing; apps that bind on a specific identity (one binding an org by UISP `clientId`, say) may care |

### 3. Catch up at boot

Retries cover a brief outage; an app down longer than the schedule would
still have a hole. Read forward once at startup from the last event id it
processed:

```http
GET /api/events?since=1234
```

(Admitted by network trust, like every server-only call.) Combined with
idempotent handlers, that closes the gap without a timer.

### Reference verification

```ts
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verify(secret: string, rawBody: string, headers: Record<string, string>): boolean {
  const ts = Number(headers['x-id-timestamp']);
  if (!Number.isFinite(ts) || Math.abs(Date.now() / 1000 - ts) > 300) return false;
  const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(`${ts}.${rawBody}`).digest('hex');
  const got = (headers['x-id-signature'] ?? '').replace(/^sha256=/, '');
  const a = Buffer.from(expected, 'hex');
  const b = Buffer.from(got, 'hex');
  return a.length === b.length && crypto.timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```

### Watching the integrations

`/admin` lists every application and derives a status:

- **listening** — registered, deliveries succeeding
- **registered, unverified** — registered, nothing delivered successfully yet
- **not listening** — registered, deliveries failing; revocations are *not*
  reaching it
- **not integrated** — the app redeems handoff codes but never registered a
  webhook at all

That last one needs no configuration to detect: id records the origin of
every app that redeems a code at `/api/token`, so an app that does login but
skipped the receiver announces itself by working. Each row shows the last
handoff, last delivery, queue depth, last error, and a **Send test event**
button.

## Remapping identities between users

One person can end up as two id users — they came through the ISP bridge
first and later signed in with Google, or a provider that does not vouch
for its addresses could not be auto-linked. `/admin` → **Merge into…** folds
one into the other: login methods move, the retired user's sessions are
revoked, and `user.merged` goes out so every app repoints its own mapping
instead of stranding rows against a user id that no longer exists.

## Adding a provider

Add one `ProviderDescriptor` to `src/providers.ts` (id, label,
`requiredKeys`, `buildAuthUrl`, `fetchUserInfo`, and whether it
`verifiesEmailDomain`). Routes, the login page, config gating, and the
admin UI pick it up automatically; `provider` columns are plain VARCHARs,
so no schema change is needed.

## Storage

Identity data lives in MySQL (the identity database) — the shared platform identity
database on **LSAidaOffice01** — and **this repository is its sole schema
owner**. There is no external schema source: `EchoDatabase/init` is not
used and must not be. `identity_db.identity_tbl_User.iUserId` is the platform-wide
person id; tenant, role, extension, and prompt data belong to the
applications (e.g. Aida UID mappings in NocoDB), never as columns here.

- `identity_tbl_User` — people
- `identity_tbl_Identity` — login methods per user (`provider`, `subject`)
- `identity_tbl_Session` — revocable, non-expiring SSO sessions
- `identity_tbl_AuthCode` — one-time app handoff codes
- `identity_tbl_App` / `identity_tbl_Event` / `identity_tbl_Delivery` — app registry & events
- `identity_tbl_SsoNonce` — UISP bridge replay guard
- `identity_tbl_DirectoryKey` — directory-ensure idempotency keys
- `identity_tbl_Migration` — applied-migration history

**Where its coordinates come from.** `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` /
`DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` are settings like any other — rows in
`auth_tbl_Settings`, or environment overrides — so a deployment is described in
one place. The pool connects lazily on first use, which makes "not filled
in yet" an ordinary first-run state rather than a crash: the app still
listens, `/setup` says which of the two stores is missing, and the schema is
applied as soon as the coordinates work. A change of coordinates takes a
restart.

### Migrations

The schema is applied at boot by `src/migrations.ts`: an ordered,
append-only list of named, **additive** migrations, each recorded in
`identity_tbl_Migration`. A fresh database gets everything; an existing one gets
only what it has not seen; a second run is a no-op; concurrent boots are
serialised by an advisory lock. The baseline migration is written as
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so a database created by an earlier
deployment adopts the history without touching existing rows — existing
users keep their `iUserId` and keep authenticating.

To change the schema, append a new named migration; never edit, rename, or
reorder a released one.

**Local vs production.** `docker-compose.yml` / `.env.example` show how to
point a dev instance at a disposable local MySQL (export `DB_HOST` and
friends, or fill the rows in NocoDB once). Production is the shared
the identity database on LSAidaOffice01 (`DB_HOST` pointing at that MySQL) — treat it as
live data at all times.

**Backup / restore / rollback (production).** Take a consistent dump
before every deploy that includes a new migration:

```bash
mysqldump --single-transaction --routines identity_db > identity_db-$(date +%F).sql   # backup
mysql identity_db < identity_db-<date>.sql                                            # restore
```

Because migrations are additive, rolling back the *app* to a previous
version is always safe (older code ignores newer tables/columns). Rolling
back the *schema* means restoring the dump taken before the deploy —
accept the data written in between as lost, which is why the dump comes
first.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # tsx watch, port 3200
npm test        # vitest
npm run build   # tsc → dist/
```

`docker-compose.yml` brings up this app and everything it owns. The only
thing it expects to already exist is NocoDB.
